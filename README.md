# Credit_Card_Transaction_Fraud_Detection

## To predict the Credit Card Transaction Fraud using the past data and behavior of the users. 

- In the Credit Card Companies, illegitimate credit card usage is a serious 
problem which results in a need to accurately detect fraudulent 
transactions vs non-fraudulent transactions.
- Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying purchase 
attempts that are fraudulent and rejecting them rather than processing 
the order.
- Here, we are trying to solve the above problem using machine learning. 
We overcome the problem by creating a binary classifier and 
experimenting with various ML models to see which predicts better.

## About Dataset & EDA
- The Dataset has been collected from Kaggle having more than 2 Lac Rows. And the Data is 
Unbalanced.
- The Dataset has 209651 rows and 20 columns. It has no duplicates and null values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis, is the act of analyzing a dataset to understand the main statistical 
characteristics with visual and statistical methods.

### ML Model
Credit card fraud detection 
using Random Forest Classifier, 
shows a powerful technique, 
once the models receive huge 
quantities of new data every 
day. Although we have reached 
good results in the model.

### Benefits:
- Reduction in number of Fraud Detection
- User can safely use his credit/debit card for 
online transaction.
- Added layer of security
